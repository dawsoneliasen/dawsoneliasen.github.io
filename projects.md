# Projects
Here's a selection of some of the many projects I have been engaged in recently.

## Automated medical coding with CNNs and transformer networks
There is a potential to add value to veterinary and human hospitals by automating the process of 'coding' health records. This coding process adds consistency and structure to Electronic Health Record data, but requires a human expert to read each and every record. I have been experimenting with the use of supervised learning to automate this process as part of my work at CSU's Veterinary Teaching Hospital. The VTH has many years of human-encoded EHRs that can be used as a labeled dataset.

## Game development in Python
Game development is a really fun way to practice object-oriented programming and abstraction. I am working on a 2D open world rogue-like/RPG in Python using PyGame.
