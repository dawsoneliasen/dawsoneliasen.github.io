# Projects
Here's a selection of some of the many projects I have been engaged in recently.

## Pearl, the Causal Inference Engine
After reading the Book of Why, I thought it would be a fun exercise to implement the causal inference methods described in the book as a Python application. This project is still in the research phase - I need to read and comprehend some of Pearl (et. al.)'s papers to understand how to properly implement the causal inference engine.

## Automated medical coding with CNNs and transformer networks
There is a potential to add value to veterinary and human hospitals by automating the process of 'coding' health records. This coding process adds consistency and structure to Electronic Health Record data, but requires a human expert to read each and every record. I have been experimenting with the use of supervised learning to automate this process.

## Meteorite data analysis
