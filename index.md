# Welcome

Hi, my name is Dawson. I'm a Data Scientist based in Denver, Colorado.
<br />

# Data Science

I've been doing data science stuff since college. I worked at small research consultancy called Mountain Data Group for a while, doing all sorts of things including deep learning, inferential analyses, lots of visualizations, data processing systems, and much more. Now I'm working at [Theta](https://thetaclv.com), another small consulting shop delivering statistical expertise in CLV and CBCV. I really love diving into data, tackling problems, investigating questions, creating beautiful visualizations and stories, and deploying elegant models and algorithms.
<br />

**I'm available to help with any data projects as a freelancer**. You can see my resume [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18y4f8Qwd2VbtiiHZ0bVQnU3bFfNl6PAB1hcUj7N-59M/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to get in touch: dawsoneliasen at gmail dot com.

# Writing

I have this casual writing habit. At [Orbis Tertius](https://orbistertius.substack.com), I write essays about esoterica, including but not limited to: mindfulness, literature, philosophy, futurism, work, and technology.
<br />

# etc.

I'm also a gamerâ„¢, craft coffee nerd, lover of pretentious books, and a bit of a sneakerhead.
