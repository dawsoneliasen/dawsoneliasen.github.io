# Welcome

Hi, my name is Dawson. I'm a Data Scientist based in Denver, Colorado.
<br />

# Data Science

I've been doing data science stuff since college. I worked at small research consultancy called Mountain Data Group for a while, doing all sorts of things including deep learning, inferential analyses, lots of visualizations, data processing systems, and much more. Now I'm working at [Theta](https://thetaclv.com), another small consulting shop delivering statistical expertise in CLV and CBCV. I really love diving into data, tackling problems, investigating questions, creating beautiful visualizations and stories, and deploying elegant models and algorithms.
<br />

# Writing

I have a nasty writing habit. At [Orbis Tertius](https://orbistertius.substack.com), I write essays about eclectic esoterica, including but not limited to: mindfulness, literature, philosophy, futurism, work, and technology.

# Book recommendations
If youâ€™re looking for a good book, take a look my [recommendations](https://bookshop.org/lists/dawson-s-top-fiction) on Bookshop. These are the books that I have found profoundly interesting and valuable. If you buy a book from that site, most of the revenue goes to support independent bookstores, and if you buy from my list, I get a little kickback, too.
