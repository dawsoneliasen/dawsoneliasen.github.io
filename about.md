# Dawson
I'm a Data Scientist based in Denver, Colorado.
<br />

I've been working in data science for over three years. I worked at small research consultancy called Mountain Data Group for a while, doing all sorts of things including deep learning, inferential analyses, lots of visualizations, data processing systems, and much more. Now I'm working at [Theta](https://thetaclv.com), another research shop delivering statistical expertise in CLV and CBCV. I really love diving into data, tackling problems, investigating questions, creating beautiful visualizations and stories, and deploying elegant models and algorithms.

I'm also a gamerâ„¢, craft coffee nerd, lover of [pretentious books](https://www.knowledgelost.org/100-pretentious-books-to-read-before-you-die/), and [casual writer](https://medium.com/@dawsoneliasen).
