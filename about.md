I'm a student and technologist living in Fort Collins, Colorado.

I'm left handed, I type 100 words per minute, and I prefer my coffee black.

I live in the lovely town of Fort Collins in northern Colorado with my beautiful girlfriend, Grace. My hobbies include writing, programming, coffee, flyfishing, hammocking, and ultimate frisbee. I'm studying data science at Colorado State University, and I am the founder of [the 4th Paradigm](the4thparadigm.com), an organization at CSU focused on giving students experience with collaborative problem solving using data-driven techniques.
